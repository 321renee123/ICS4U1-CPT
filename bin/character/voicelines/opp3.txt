Greetings. It is I, Pollynomial.
It appears that I have been approached by a member of species |homo sapien. 
Since you have foolishly imposed your feeble presence within |my radial distance, then I shall gladly take you on.
You shall perish, you languid, asinine vagabond!
Activating the might of simple arithmetic calculations!
Thou shalt not pass unless you answer 5 correctly!
